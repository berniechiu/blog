We know observing performance is tedious and tiresome. But what if we continue to write codes that poison the repo and later become legacy which somehow results in software regression? Because of the situation like this, we all want the code itself to be more readable, explainable and performant by default, so others are able to benefit from reading it and leaning from the codebase.

By giving few real world examples on how we optimize large scaled apps in practice, I hope it will help programmers to clearly understand the step by step procedure to think of their codes with more conventional ways of approaching modern software principles. Bringing the happiness to yourself, and also to others
