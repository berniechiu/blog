I didn’t code quite often when I studied in college first few years. Even though the school was teaching all sorts of programming languages, I was still wondering what I could achieved with all the school trainings. Teachers were just simply giving us out all the boring assignments like mathematical or data structure problems, not telling us how the real world coders were like. After a year of C++ classes, I still had no idea how to program a complete software. Besides, I see none of my classmates building anything interesting at all and the their codes had no stuctures (No OO patterns, No Architectures, just gibberish). Even Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, could build a Facebook in his freshman year which astonished those close to him. (Maybe my college sucks, or maybe just simply Mark learnt how to code in his early age)

After all, I still enjoy all those computer stuff on the Internet and wonder how they build it. But when did I start building my own web project? Fortunately in 2012, I discovered [Codedcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), which gives me a lot of inspiration and after that my progress has grown in a big leap.

Even though some of the trainings are difficult for me, the excercises are all on-the-hand experiences. I could see the result instantly and all the computer enthusiasts are gathering around the site. They share their obastacles and problems and willing to help other new programmers. It’s a pleasant environment to learn how to code.

After few months of self trainings, I was hired by a charity group and built a static website for them. With all the help I could get like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and Open Source. my website covered with a few animated effects crafted with jQuery and few of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript FrontEnd skills. Since then, I’ve begun to enjoy the beauty of web technology.

Not until recently, I also discovered another website called [Code Conquest](http://www.codeconquest.com/). It explains all my doubts and problems. The site provide lots of information for people who want to become a good coder or web developer. And now, I believe I’m more a confident coder than ever before.
